        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>What is there to say about the quaint bald Italian man? Many make the quick and easy joke of name-calling him the "Mussolini of the 21st century" because of course they do. However, that is reserved for the friendly jabs from his closest acquainteces, and he takes it in stride. It doesn't help that he has a book or two about that infamous historical figure.</p>
            <p>The man is worldly, born in South Africa, grown up in Mozambique, and having lived, studied and worked in Portugal, he has also been in many other places. A translator by trade, he aspires to be a writer, but the circumstances of life have forced him upon a road he once didn't consider as one for himself. A foolish thought, now that he is immersing himself in the world of programming. With over 30 years-worth of experience behind his back, Giulio is ready to take on the challenge of programming and system architectures so that he may have a more stable and productive future.</p>
            <p>Whether or not he will be successful will be a matter of perseverence and discipline, but also one of intellectual curiousity and ability to work with others. May he do well in his personal quest to self-betterment.</p>
